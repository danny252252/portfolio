        I think, It's always hard to talk about yourself. Of course I can talk
        more about what have I <br /> done and how,but for this section I feel like
        it's better to talk who am I.<br />  I'm from Hungary and I always tried to
        be the funniest guy at the group of my friends,with<br /> more or less
        success. I really like to talk with people and get to know them
        better.<br /> My hobbies are Anime watching, Manga reading, coding, gaming and if I have extra
        time,then be with my<br /> family or friends.<br /> Even at my younger ages I was
        already competitive and I always found the way to be better<br /> than
        everybody. <br /> About 4-5 years ago, I started paying much attention to
        programming, before that it was<br /> just a hobby for me.<br /> Although I don't
        have any higher education,but I have really hunger for knowledge.<br /> I'd
        live my life as it's our only chance to bring out the best of ourselves.<br />
         Thank you if you had your patience to read it so far. <br /> Yours
        Sincerely,<br /> Daniel Beck <br /><br />P.S: And hey, I'm seriously funny! Look:<br /><br /> How
        many storm troopers does it take to change a lightbulb? None, because
        they are all on the dark side. Padabum!
